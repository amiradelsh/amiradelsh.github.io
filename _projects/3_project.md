The interior design of the project has been developed by a renowned consulting firm, drawing inspiration from both modern and historical architecture of Tehran. The raw renderings were produced using Revit's V-Ray renderer, providing realistic visualizations of the design. All materials, from tiles to wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, are based on actual material references selected by the consultant, ensuring alignment with the construction specifications.

The Architectural BIM model has been continuously coordinated with the MEP and Structural BIM models to ensure seamless integration across disciplines. All structural, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical elements have been modeled to a Level of Development (LOD) 350, allowing for detailed representation and precise constructability analysis. Ongoing coordination meetings were conducted to identify and resolve conflicts, with a total of 185 hard clashes detected using Navisworks and successfully resolved before finalizing the construction documents.
> I was responsible for conducting clash detection tests using Navisworks and played a key role in organizing and managing coordination meetings to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and issue resolution.

This isometric view showcases the fully integrated MEP systems modeled at LOD 350, ensuring precise coordination and constructability. 

  This video presents the Revit Architecture Model using the Section Box tool, revealing detailed architectural elements of the architecture BIM model.
