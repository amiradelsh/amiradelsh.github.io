> The structural BIM model was developed using Tekla Structures, ensuring precision in steel detailing. The MEP and architectural models were subsequently completed in Revit based on the Structure Model in IFC2x3 Steel Detailing View file, enabling seamless coordination and integration among disciplines.This approach ensured an optimized workflow, improved constructibility, and enhanced project efficiency.
