 Contemporary archetypes in a compact urban fabric: This small-scale commercial building in Birjand reinterprets the architectural arch as a spatial and sculptural element. Designed as a composition of interlocking volumes and crafted in brick, concrete, and glass, the building balances transparency and mass. I led the architectural design, BIM modeling, and on-site supervision under RENA, where I served as CEO. The project is modeled in Revit with architecture, structure, and MEP integrated. Currently under construction, it aligns with Iran’s Chapter 19 energy standards, with the façade now being implemented.

 The site is located in a high-value neighborhood where much of the surrounding architecture is older and often lacking in design quality. As the first newly designed building in the area in years, this project was an opportunity to gently introduce a different architectural approach. The hope was to offer a thoughtful response to the site while encouraging a more design-conscious direction for future developments.

 The building is shaped by clean, interlocking volumes, aiming for a simple yet expressive form. A restrained palette of brick, glass, and concrete was chosen to highlight contrasts between solid and void, and between textured and smooth surfaces. The arch motif appears throughout the design — in openings, balconies, and the ‘Elevated Vitrine,’ which allows the facade to engage more directly with the street.

It was developed using Revit Architecture, Structure, and MEP, modeled to an LOD 300 standard to ensure coordination across disciplines. BIM coordination was conducted in parallel with ongoing construction, allowing dynamic updates especially for MEP components.
