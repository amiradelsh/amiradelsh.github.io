<p><strong>—Project Overview:</strong></p>
This project is a commercial complex located in the western foothill lands of Tehran, Municipal District 22, directly adjacent to the Persian Gulf Lake. I joined in the design development phase, after the studio had secured the commission with initial concept designs, and stayed through to the completion of execution planning. The scope included a landscape area of 32,080 m² and a total gross built area of 26,290 m², distributed across three phases with net floor areas of 1,864 m² (Phase 1), 3,596 m² (Phase 2), 2,618 m² (Phase 3), and a total commercial area of 13,414 m².

<p><strong>—Context & Technical challenges:</strong></p>
The project started with highly fragmented workflows. Architectural information existed in disconnected formats: SketchUp (.skp) for massing, Rhino (.3dm) for complex geometry, and AutoCAD (.dwg/.dxf) for 2D documentation and permits. Model synchronization was non-existent, format conversions caused data loss, manual clean-ups were required on every revision, and changes in one file rarely propagated to the others. File sizes in Rhino frequently exceeded 1.5 GB, output standards were inconsistent, and version control was absent. To resolve this, I rebuilt the entire complex as a single, up-to-date Revit model at lower LOD levels, consolidating all 2D and 3D information into one authoritative source.

    </div>
  </div>

<p><strong>—Role & Modelling Scope:</strong></p>
I worked as the sole Architectural BIM Modeller. My primary task was to convert all fragmented 2D drawings and 3D models into a single, consistent Revit architecture model suitable for sharing across the design team. Once the model was complete, I took full responsibility for all visualizations, diagrams, presentation boards, and competition submission sheets. I also contributed to concept design refinements prior to the modelling phase.

    </div>
  </div>




<p><strong>—Coordination & Collaboration:</strong></p>
Coordination between disciplines was initially minimal and unstructured. By delivering a centralized Revit model I created the first reliable common reference for the architectural scope. I interfaced directly with the architecture team, graphic designers, branding specialists, and marketing. All modelling and visualization deliverables were reviewed and approved by the Head of Studio, Dr. Morteza Adib, and Maryam Yousefi.

<p><strong>—Constraints & Responsibilities:</strong></p>
The project was constrained by tight schedules and limited budget, which dictated the lower LOD and focused the effort on speed and consistency rather than high-detail constructability. Concept design, regulatory approvals, permitting, and detailed execution design remained outside my scope. I worked exclusively from the supplied fragmented models, 2D documents, and approved initial concepts.

<p><strong>—Deliverables & Outcome:</strong></p>
I delivered a low-LOD architectural Revit model (functioning as the federated architectural source) together with complete visualization packages, diagrams, presentation materials, and final competition sheets. These outputs were used directly for the project’s international competition entry and formed a critical part of the submission that won the Prix Versailles Design Award (France, December 2018).

  </div>


<p><strong>—Reflection & Key Learnings:</strong></p>
The project demonstrated the immediate value of moving from fragmented, multi-platform workflows to a single Revit environment, even at modest LOD levels. The biggest gains came from eliminating repeated manual conversions and establishing one reliable source of truth for both documentation and visualization. The award success confirmed that a well-structured model, paired with high-quality visual deliverables produced by a single modeller, can decisively support competition outcomes under real time and budget pressure. On a future project I would implement basic shared naming conventions and a lightweight Common Data Environment from day one to reduce coordination overhead even further.
